> ### Vanilla Js + Functional Components + history API real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://js-playground-two.vercel.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vanilla Js + Functional components + history API** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

This is still an unfinished project.

This project was planned with the idea that it is easy to learn if you learn vanilla sufficiently before learning frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte.
Also, the project structure and state management pattern is similar to the most popular React approach.

## Getting Started

You can't view a live demo over at [Demo](https://js-playground-two.vercel.app)

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server 
- `npm test` to start the jest library
